Water Lily
============

Water Lily is a minimal two column responsive theme designed to showcase artwork and photography using Masonry. It's simple for new users to set up and looks best with large images and a minimal sidebar. Once installed and activated you can customize the site by changing the background colour and upload your logo. Developers can easily extend the code in a child theme. French translation is provided. 

Thank's once again to everyone at Automattic for creating _s and the Monster Widget. 
Both are useful for making theme development a pleasure. 

Google Web Fonts used: Oswald, Noto Sans.

This theme requires that you use WordPress version 3.9 or higher. 
Masonry is not compatible with older version of WordPress.
